> The process is **seeded with** $N$ vectors ...

From *Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoders for Molecule Design*



> GNNs **follow** a neighborhood aggregation **scheme**, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and trans- forming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes.

> Recently, there has been **a surge of interest in** Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches for representation learning of graphs.

From *How Powerful Are Graph Neural Networks?*



> Since molecules can be optimized in different ways, there are multiple viable translations for each input graph. 

From *Learning Multimodal Graph to Graph Translation for Molecular Optimization*



> ... converge to **brittle** solutions

From *[Ankesh Anand's blog](https://ankeshanand.com/blog/2020/01/26/contrative-self-supervised-learning.html)*



>The goal of drug discovery is to design molecules with desirable chemical properties. The task is challenging since the chemical space is vast and often difficult to navigate.
