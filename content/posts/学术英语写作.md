> The process is **seeded with** $N$ vectors ...

From *Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoders for Molecule Design*



> GNNs **follow** a neighborhood aggregation **scheme**, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and trans- forming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes.

> Recently, there has been **a surge of interest in** Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches for representation learning of graphs.
